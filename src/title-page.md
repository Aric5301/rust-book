# The Rust Programming Language

*by Steve Klabnik, Carol Nichols, and Chris Krycho, with contributions from the Rust Community*

*(and with experimental modifications!)*

This version of the text assumes you’re using Rust 1.85.0 (released 2025-02-17)
or later with `edition = "2024"` in the Cargo.toml file of all projects to
configure them to use Rust 2024 edition idioms. See the [“Installation” section
of Chapter 1][install]<!-- ignore --> to install or update Rust.

The experimental version is only available online and in English. 
The non-experimental version is available offline with installations of Rust made with `rustup`; run `rustup doc
--book` to open.

Several community [translations] of the non-experimental version are also available.
The non-experimental text is available in [paperback and ebook format from No Starch
Press][nsprust].
